		My name is Hayden Itai Main. I'm 18 years old and I was born and raised in Windsor Ontario.
		<br>Ever since I was younger, I had a keen interest in the arts. Most of my hobbies had stemmed from that. <br>I started to draw every day around 6, and from there I pushed myself to take it more seriously. <br>I then branched off into painting, photography, etc. and got better with that as well. I also took up <br> a bit of musical arts as well. Aside from the arts, my hobbies include sucking at video games that I <br>attempt to play and talking with friends. I'm not sure if socializing could be considered a hobby though.

		<br>I do suffer from borderline personality disorder and social anxiety, but I do my best to get by. <br>It can be severely exhausting, but a lot of the time I use the symptoms to help with my artwork.<br>With borderline, I dissociate quite often, which is hard to describe. I pretty much stop feeling real,<br>and during that time I find that there is this art style that comes out of me that visually describes the feelings.<br> It's not myself, but a part of me that I can't piece to my puzzle.

		The best way to describe my way of life is "A Big World for a Small Man." because I <br>am doing my besy to get by. The world may seem massive in comparison to this tiny illusion <br>that is my existence, but I am doing my best to live it to the fullest. Life's strange, but I'll be even stranger.

	<h2>Simon Fuller</h2>
	<p>
	Hello, my name is Simon Fuller and I am 28 years old.  Welcome to the webpage I hope you enjoy what you see.  There are too many interesting subjects that I would love to empty my heart about, therefore I will only focus on the most important.  Music drives my life. If you enjoy any style of electonic music, we can probably be friends.  From the deep dark depths of techno to the emotional drones of ambient, there is an aspect of every genre that I have an attraction to.  My imagination and lust for new experiences make me an active person.  The beauty of the unknown makes life worth living.
