# main_h_fuller_s_teamproject 
This assignment is to create a webpage about the team members working on said assignment. The webpage will consist of an image for each member along with a few paragraphs regarding their hobbies, hometown, and other biographic information they wish to include. Each member can also include social media links if they would like. This project was essentially a way for the team members to figure out how to use git.hub and the way things on the site work such as branches and pull requests.
